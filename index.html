        <p id="starting_paragraph">For the experience of a college student it can be tedious to have to repetiviely search for individual professor ratings. Based on that why not cut the time of searching for individual professors and look at ratings of all the professors that
            teach a particular course at your university. What you need to do is type in the university that you want to search the courses of then type in the desired course you want to see the ratings of.
